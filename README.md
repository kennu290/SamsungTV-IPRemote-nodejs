#SamsungRemote

The SamsungRemote class is a JavaScript class that allows you to control a Samsung Smart TV through its remote control API.

Â¤Usage

To use the SamsungRemote class, you first need to install it:

npm install samsung-remote

Then, you can create a new SamsungRemote object by passing the following parameters to the constructor:

    name: a string representing the name of the remote control.
    ip: a string representing the IP address of the Samsung Smart TV.
    port (optional): a number representing the port used by the Samsung Smart TV's remote control API. The default value is 8001.
    token: a string representing the token used to authenticate with the Samsung Smart TV's remote control API.

Here's an example of how to create a new SamsungRemote object:

javascript

const SamsungRemote = require('samsung-remote');

const remote = new SamsungRemote('myRemote', '192.168.1.100', 8001, 'myToken');

Once you have a SamsungRemote object, you can send remote control commands to the Samsung Smart TV by calling the sendKey method with a string representing the key you want to send. Here's an example:

javascript

remote.sendKey('power');

This will send a power key press to the Samsung Smart TV, turning it on or off.
